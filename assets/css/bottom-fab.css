/*SWAK NOTE (TODO): Changed from position: absolute to fixed due to FF issues, possibly involving ng-repeat content. 
Tried on index, included with ng-include, and manually inserting on each template. 
FAB will not scroll with content, but only in FF, with default css.
Tested this with FF 40.0.2, try again in later versions to see if it is resolved. */
